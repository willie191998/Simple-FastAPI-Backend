## SIMPLE FastAPI Backend

**Author:**
Wilson Anorue

# Project Overview
This project is a robust backend for a ride-sharing application, developed using FastAPI. It showcases various modern web development practices and technologies to create a fast, secure, and scalable API.

# Key Features
- **FastAPI:** Utilizes FastAPI for faster API responses, easy documentation, and native support for asynchronous programming.

- **Pydantic:** Implements Pydantic for type checking, enhancing security and data processing to prevent SQL Injection and XSS attacks.

- **Internal Routing:** Incorporates internal routing for better organization and scalability, making it easier to extend and manage as the project grows.

- **Slack Integration:** Utilizes Slack for real-time monitoring and notifications, ensuring quick responses to potential issues.

- **Dockerized Backend:** The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent development and deployment environments.

- **ORM with SQL Database:** Implements an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for seamless interaction with a MySQL database, simplifying database operations and relationships.
